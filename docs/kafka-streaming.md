## Proposal Overview

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) currently utilizes **Message Queues (MQ)** for inter-application communication. While MQ has been a reliable solution, evolving data requirements and scalability demands call for a more modern architecture.

As RBI's designated **Technical/IT Partner**, **ReBIT** proposes migrating to a **Kafka-based streaming solution** to overcome current limitations and future-proof the infrastructure. This document presents:

1. **Key benefits** of Kafka over traditional MQ:
   - Real-time data processing capabilities
   - Horizontal scalability for growing workloads
   - Built-in fault tolerance and high availability
   - Stream processing functionality

2. **Implementation approach**:
   - Phased migration roadmap
   - Integration strategy with existing systems
   - Security and compliance considerations

3. **Expected outcomes**:
   - Enhanced system performance and reduced latency
   - Improved data reliability and consistency
   - Future-ready architecture for evolving needs

This transition will enable **event-driven communication** while maintaining the stringent security and compliance standards required for financial systems.

2. **Improve Profile Visibility**: Make sure to write an attractive bio that summarizes what your business is about and use a eye-catching profile image, such as your logo. Add a link to your website or a specific campaign you're promoting.

5. **Utilize Instagram Shopping**: Take benefit of Instagram's Shop tool (also known as Instagram Marketplace), which allows businesses to create an online shopping platform. This makes it convenient for customers to browse and purchase products directly from the app.

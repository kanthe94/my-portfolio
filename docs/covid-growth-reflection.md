The global nature of the pandemic highlighted the interconnectedness of our world. It reinforced the significance of global cooperation and solidarity, teaching me the importance of coming together as a community to address collective challenges. The experience prompted me to contribute to initiatives aimed at supporting those in need and giving back to society.

During the COVID period, I became more self-aware, understanding my strengths and weaknesses. This self-awareness allowed me to focus on personal growth areas and develop strategies to overcome obstacles. I actively pursued continuous learning, seeking out new knowledge and skills to remain relevant in a rapidly changing world.

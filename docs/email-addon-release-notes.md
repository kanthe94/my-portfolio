## New Features

### Feature 1: Subscription Email Add-On Plan Details

- Users now have access to a new feature that allows them to view the details of their subscribed **Email Add-On Plan**.
- To access the plan details, navigate to the **Organization** section and select *Projects* or *Billing*. Under **My Plan**, users can now find an overview of their monthly and daily email usage, as well as IP usage.
- Notifications will be sent to all account admins and *emailteam@clevertap.com* when volume thresholds are reached (>=70%, >=90%, >=100%). This will help users effectively manage their monthly usage and plan accordingly.

### Feature 2: Sending AMP HTML Content in Email Campaigns

- We have introduced a new feature that enables users with an Email Add-On plan to send AMP HTML content in their email campaigns.
- To utilize this feature, users can navigate to the **Sender** section within the Email Campaign content.
- Additionally, relevant statistics such as opens, sends, and clicks will be provided for mime type AMP/HTML, allowing users to track the performance of their AMP HTML email campaigns.
